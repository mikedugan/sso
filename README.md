To include it via composer add the following line in your "require" to composer.json:

```json
"mikedugan/vatsim-sso": "dev-master"
```

To use it:

```php
$sso = new Sso\Sso($base, $key, $secret, $method, $cert);
```

Additional documentation will be available on the VATSIM forums.
Laravel support coming soon!
